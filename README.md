## 📌 Overview

Welcome to the **Sorting Algorithm Visualizer**, a powerful and interactive educational tool built using **Streamlit**. Whether you're a student learning sorting for the first time, a developer revisiting algorithm fundamentals, or an educator demonstrating concepts to others — this app is for you!

With real-time animations, color-coded visual feedback, and side-by-side Python and C++ code, this tool brings sorting algorithms to life.

---

## 🎯 Key Features

### ✅ Choose from Six Classic Sorting Algorithms:
- Bubble Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Selection Sort
- Merge Sort
- Quick Sort
- Heap Sort

Each algorithm comes with its own description, time complexity, and language-specific implementations.

---

### ⚙️ Customization Options

- **Array Size Slider**: Select the number of elements (from 5 to 100).
- **Speed Control**: Visualize at your pace (from 0.01s to 1.0s per step).
- **Sorting Order**: Toggle between **Ascending** and **Descending**.
- **New Dataset Generation**: Shuffle and reset the array instantly for fresh testing.

---

### 🌈 Color-Coded Visuals

Track algorithm progress through intuitive, animated bars:
- 🔴 **Red** – Elements currently being compared.
- 🔁 **Orange/Yellow** – Elements being swapped.
- ✅ **Green** – Sorted elements in their final position.
- 🔵 **Blue** – Unsorted or untouched elements.

---

### 💻 Real-Time Statistics

- 🔢 **Comparisons Counter**: Watch how many comparisons each algorithm makes.
- 🔁 **Swaps Counter**: See how many element swaps are performed.

This helps users understand performance differences and algorithmic efficiency.

---

### 📄 View Source Code – Instantly!

For each algorithm, you can view:
- 🐍 Python Code
- 💻 C++ Code

This allows learners to connect theory with implementation — across two popular programming languages.

---

## 📚 Educational Benefits

### 👨‍🎓 For Students
Gain visual intuition and a deeper understanding of how sorting works under the hood.

### 🧑‍💻 For Developers
Experiment with different algorithms and datasets. Use it as a playground to compare performance and logic.

### 👩‍🏫 For Teachers
Use this as a teaching tool during lectures or workshops. It provides a clear, animated way to explain sorting processes.

## 🧮 Sample Algorithm Description (Bubble Sort)

> **Bubble Sort:** Repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.

- **Best Case:** O(n)
- **Average Case:** O(n²)
- **Worst Case:** O(n²)
