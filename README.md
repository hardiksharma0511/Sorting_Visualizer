<h2 align="center">A Visual Journey Through the World of Sorting Algorithms</h2>


Welcome to the Sorting Algorithm Visualizer! 🚀 This interactive application allows you to witness the power of six essential sorting algorithms in real-time. Whether you're a student trying to grasp how algorithms work or a developer looking to visualize your code, this tool is designed to make sorting an engaging and educational experience.

## Key Features
### 📊 Real-Time Algorithm Visualization
Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Selection Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, Heap Sort — All at your fingertips!
Watch as the algorithms sort a randomly generated array step by step. See the magic unfold in real-time!

### ⚙️ Customization Options
Control the Speed: Adjust how fast or slow the sorting happens.
Choose Your Array Size: Start with a small array and watch as the algorithms handle both small and large datasets.
Generate New Data: Click a button to generate a completely new set of numbers for sorting. Every time you click, a new challenge awaits!

### 🌈 Color-Coded Visualization
Color changes highlight the comparisons and swaps happening in the array, helping you understand the inner workings of each algorithm.
As elements are sorted, the algorithm will visually indicate the "sorted" parts, showing you exactly how the array is progressing toward completion.

### 🧑‍🏫 Learn by Doing
Whether you’re learning algorithms for the first time or revisiting them, this visual tool makes sorting algorithms easier to understand.
Get a deeper understanding of how different sorting techniques work and how they compare in performance.

## Why Use the Sorting Algorithm Visualizer?
### 🎯 For Students & Learners
Sorting algorithms can be difficult to grasp when only taught theoretically. This tool makes the process interactive and fun. Watch how the array evolves with each step to understand what happens under the hood.

### 🖥️ For Developers
Already familiar with algorithms? Fine-tune your knowledge by seeing how each algorithm behaves with different datasets. You can even modify the tool to fit your needs!

### 🚀 For Enthusiasts & Educators
Create an engaging environment to explain sorting algorithms with hands-on demonstrations. Teachers can use this tool to teach their students in a more interactive and impactful way.

## How It Works

* Generate Random Data: The array of numbers that you wish to sort will be generated randomly.
* Choose an Algorithm: Select one of six classic sorting algorithms.
* Set the Speed: Adjust the sorting speed using a slider. Slow it down to see every step or speed it up for a quick demonstration.
* Start Sorting: Click a button to begin sorting. The algorithm will execute while showing live, color-coded updates in the array.
* Reset and Repeat: Hit reset to clear the array and generate a new set of data. Try out different algorithms and settings to see how they perform.

## Visual Appeal: Learning Through Color and Animation 🎨
The sorting process is represented with colorful bars, where each bar's height corresponds to the array's value. As the algorithm progresses, each bar changes color to reflect different states:

* Red: Current elements being compared.
* Green: Elements that are in their final sorted position.
* Blue/Orange/Yellow: Elements that are being swapped or moved.
This dynamic, color-coded representation is designed to help you track the progress and steps of the sorting process.

## Benefits of Using This Tool
* Interactive Learning: Instead of simply reading about sorting algorithms, interact with them and observe how they work.
* Compare Algorithms: Understand the performance differences between sorting algorithms by watching how they handle the same dataset.
* Instant Feedback: The application provides real-time visual feedback as each algorithm sorts the data, helping you connect the theory with practice.
